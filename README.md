# Barons Cleaning Services Website

## Overview
This repository contains the official marketing website for **Barons Cleaning Services**, a family-owned and operated commercial cleaning company providing day porter and property maintenance services throughout California’s Central Valley.

The site is built as a fast, mobile-first static website focused on generating qualified leads from commercial property managers through clear service positioning, strong calls to action, and proof-driven content.

---

## Problem Statement
Commercial property managers need reliable daytime cleanup services that keep properties clean, safe, and presentable while tenants and customers are on-site. Many service websites fail to clearly communicate scope, responsiveness, and real-world results.

This website solves that by:
- Clearly explaining day porter coverage and included services
- Addressing common pain points like dumped items and loitering cleanup
- Providing multiple low-friction conversion paths (call, email, walkthrough)
- Showcasing before-and-after proof to build credibility and trust

---

## Site Architecture

**High-level flow:**
1. Visitors land on a conversion-focused homepage.
2. Services are explained through dedicated pages.
3. Proof galleries reinforce credibility.
4. Users convert via phone call, email, or walkthrough request.

**Core pages:**
- Home
- Day Porter Services
- Additional Services
- Service Areas
- About Us
- Contact / Request a Quote
- FAQs
- Privacy Policy
